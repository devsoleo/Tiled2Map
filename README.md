# Tiled2Map
**Tiled2Map** is a handy tool designed to simplify the conversion of JSON files generated by the Tiled map editor. Tiled is a 2D map maker software commonly used in game development. It exports maps in JSON format, where all the data is listed sequentially. For instance, a map with dimensions 100x100 would be exported as a single list of 10,000 elements, like so: `tiles = [1, 321, 12, 132, 3123]`. It also automatically handles multiple dynamic layers, unless they are empty.

Tiled2Map was created to convert these JSON files provided by Tiled into JSON files structured in a more conventional format, where map data is organized as `[columns][rows]` or `[x][y]`.

This tool is written in Go and is freely available for public use. Whether for personal or commercial projects, Tiled2Map can be utilized without any restrictions.
